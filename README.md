# React Student Dashboard
This will be a project of which the end result will actually be used for the Winc Academy: namely a Student Dashboard!
Purpose: to make it easy for Winc teachers to see in one overview how the students evaluate the assignments
We would like to see, per assignment, the evaluation of each student in a "Bar Chart".
**Tools: Use a JavaScript framework such as React.

##### Assignment:  React Student Dashboard
##### Result: https://student-dashboard-4149bd.netlify.app/



### Data :
The link below is to a spreadsheet file (in Google Docs) with a mountain of fake data (also called mock data), with fake students. These are the results of students once they complete all assignment evaluations.
>- Winc Final Assignment - Student Mock data

##### As you can see, this data has the following structure:
>- Student's name
>- Name of the assignment / project (including the project code)
>- Figure how fun the assignment was
>- Figure how difficult the assignment was

It is up to you to model and structure the data correctly. Do not type the data overflow, it is way too much data for that.

### Requirements:
Your Web Application should display the following
>- Dashboard Overview User story: As a user, when I open the homepage of the application, I want to see an overview in the form of a bar chart of the evaluations (fun & difficult) of all students.
As a user I have to be able to distinguish at a glance between the assignments and the fun / difficult evaluation. Make sure that a clear distinction is made visually, for example by working with clear colors. 

>Separate routing per student As a user I want to see a list of the names of all students and be able to click on one of these students. When I click on a student name, I am taken to the route / {name-of-student}. The bar chart adjusts with the data of this student only.
