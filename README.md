# React Student Dashboard
This will be a project of which the end result will actually be used for the Winc Academy: namely a Student Dashboard!
Purpose: to make it easy for Winc teachers to see in one overview how the students evaluate the assignments
We would like to see, per assignment, the evaluation of each student in a "Bar Chart".
**Tools: Use a JavaScript framework such as React.

##### Assignment:  React Student Dashboard
##### Result: https://student-dashboard-4149bd.netlify.app/



### Data :
The link below is to a spreadsheet file (in Google Docs) with a mountain of fake data (also called mock data), with fake students. These are the results of students once they complete all assignment evaluations.

Winc Final Assignment - Student Mock data

As you can see, this data has the following structure:

Student's name
Name of the assignment / project (including the project code)
Figure how fun the assignment was
Figure how difficult the assignment was
It is up to you to model and structure the data correctly. Do not type the data overflow, it is way too much data for that.

A good way to work with data is a CSV file. You can download the data from Google Sheets as CSV. You can also work directly with the data from Google Sheets.
